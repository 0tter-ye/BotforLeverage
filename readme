ðŸ”¹ **Explanation of the Trading Bot**
    - Fetches market data from Binance every 60 seconds.
    - Uses a Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover strategy:
    - If SMA_5 crosses above SMA_20 â†’ BUY
    - If SMA_5 crosses below SMA_20 â†’ SELL
    - Places market buy/sell orders accordingly.
    - The bot waits for 60 seconds before re-evaluating the market.

ðŸ“Œ **How to Test Sell Signals?**
**Option 1: Reduce Sleep Time**
    You can reduce the time interval between market evaluations, e.g.:

    ```Python 
    time.sleep(10)  # Wait only 10 seconds before checking again
    ```
    This allows the bot to detect sell signals faster.

**Option 2: Use a Smaller Timeframe**
    Change:

    ```Python
    timeframe = '1m'  # 1-minute candles
    ```
    To:

    ```Python
    timeframe = '15s'  # 15-second candles (smaller timeframe)
    ```
    This lets the bot see trend changes faster, but increases API calls.
